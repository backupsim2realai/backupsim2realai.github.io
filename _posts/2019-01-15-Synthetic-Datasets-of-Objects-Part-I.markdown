Similar to vector graphics for images, this representations allows resampling the surface data at arbitrary resolutions, with or without connectivity information (i.e. into a point cloud or a mesh).

[GMSH](http://gmsh.info/) 3D dimentional finite element mesh generator --- converts parametric shapes to meshes. [This link](http://gmsh.info/screencasts/) shows how to use the software.

#### STL format
The format only describes the 3D surface geometry of the object *i.e.* information about 3D vertices and normals is provided and no information of colour, texture or other possible meta-data relevant for the model is included. These files are usually generated by a CAD program and are most commonly used in the 3D printing. They store the 3D information using a concept called "tessellation" where a primitive shape (*e.g.* a triangle described by three vertices and a normal) is repeated across to encode the surface geometry without overlaps and gaps. The format was invented by the _Albert Consulting Group_ for [3D systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Systems), a company co-founded by [Chuck Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull), in 1987. Chuck had then invented stereolithographic 3D printer and his company were looking for a way to transfer the information from 3D CAD models to the printer and realised they could use the concept of "tessellation" to describe the geometry. For instance, the image below shows different levels of tessellation of sphere done with a triangle.

STL files come in two different flavours namely ASCII and Binary and contain descriptions of 3 vertex facets including their normals. The ordering of the vertices complies with the right hand rule. The main restriction placed upon the facets in STL files is that all adjacent facets must share two common vertices. 


#### OBJ format 

The OBJ format was created by [Wavefront Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_Technologies) to store lines, polygons, and free-form curves and objects. Similar to STL it stores the surface geometry but unlike STL it also stores the colour and texture information. OBJ format can approximate surface geometry without blowing up the size of the model using bezier curves or NURBS. There are multiple ways to store the geometry with OBJ format. In its simplest form, OBJ allows tessellation of the geometry in the form of triangles, quadrilaterals or more complext polygons. The vertices and normals of the polygons are stored to encode the geometry. Other ways to encode geometry with OBJ include free-form curves like bezier curves and free-form surfaces like NURBS. Free-form surfaces are more precise and they lead to smaller file sizes at higher precision compared to other methods. Although STL remains the most popular format for 3D printing, the size of the file very quickly increases for high-resolution 3D models and the lack of colour information makes it somewhat restrictive and therefore OBJ has been slowly becoming a popular choice.

<div><figure><img align="left" src="/assets/img/2019-01-15/texture_mapping.gif" width="25%"></figure> OBJ format supports colour and texture in an accompanying file with .MTL extension which allows the end-user to render a multi-coloured textured model. The MTL file encodes various intrinsic properties of object (<i>e.g.</i> ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, transparency etc.) as well as texture maps that allow mapping an image onto a 3D surface <i>e.g.</i> in the animation on the left, the 2D textured image is wrapped around the 3D cube where vertices of cube are projected on the 2D atlas and their colours are interpolated from the image. </div>


### Synthetic Datasets

[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) have a large repository of CAD models that are freely available for research purposes.
[Yobi3D](https://www.yobi3d.com/) allows searching 3D models.
[Unity3D](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/) has an asset store for the 3D models.
[3DWarehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en) search for any 3D model.

Synthetic object datasets have remained popular particularly among researchers in computer vision and graphics since the early 2000s. We have listed some of the popular datasets since 2003 until 2018 in the table below. We observed that both graphics and vision researchers have focussed either on the geometry (in the form of meshes and point clouds) or variation among the classes of shapes but very little about their use within physics engines for control. Therefore, until recently, most datasets did not provide any articulation information (hinges or joints) of the objects and their parts.

Moreover, we have observed that the size of the publicly available datasets of synthetic 3D objects has continued to grow linearly on logarithmic scale *i.e* the size of the biggest dataset has increased by a factor of ~10. Though ShapeNets remains as the biggest dataset but not all the models are publicly available. Recently, ABC dataset have collected 1M high quality CAD models of large variety of objects.

> For physics simulation, articulations in the form of hinges and joints as well as collisions shapes of objects in the form of bounding volumes etc. are important.


### What should an ideal object dataset look like then? 

- Should contain large variety of objects and intra-class variability. The dataset should also aim to have uniform distribution of all kinds of classes to avoid any bias towards a particular set.
- Preferably synthetic as collecting water-tight models of real world objects still remains very challenging. Not because it requires labourious scanning of the object from multiple views but it requires the intent of the reconstruction to be conveyed to the robot or user. This is more relevant when scanning objects that have hinges and joints *e.g.* one needs to open the cabinet (the intent here is to open) to see what is inside and how to scan it and ensure that the scans are registered appropriately with the previously collected ones. Scanning what is behind the object is difficult. Therefore, synthetic object models will likely be essential to sidestep these problems. 
- Preferably CAD models so they can be downsampled/upsampled to any arbitrary resolution without any loss of data. CAD models are essential as they are metrically accurate and can be converted to STL or OBJ format (vice-versa is lossy). Additionally, if you are stiching different CAD models together the relative rotation and translation can be easily obtained via a CAD software. This avoids the calibration/registration process that one has to do on the real world data. Furthermore, they can be 3D printed and therefore provide a perfect simulation to real world match of the 3D model.
- Should come with [collision shapes](https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-ii-collision-detection-for-solid-objects), physical properties (*e.g.* friction, center of mass, intertia) as well as articulation information so they can be used directly into a physics engine. 
- Despite availability of large scale of 3D models of objects finding bespoke 3D objects requires artists and designers to come together to create those assets --- a term often called content creation. This is time consuming and requires multiple iterations between the client and the designer.
