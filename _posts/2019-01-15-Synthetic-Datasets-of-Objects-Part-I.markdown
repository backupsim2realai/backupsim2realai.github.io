Desirable properties for any object dataset

-  Large size
-  Variation 
-  Diversity 
-  Parametric representation 
-  High Entropy (balance in the classes) 

### Historic Perspective

### Data formats

#### STL format
The format only describes the 3D surface geometry of the object *i.e.* information about 3D vertices and normals is provided and no information of colour, texture or other possible meta-data relevant for the model is included. These files are usually generated by a CAD program and are most commonly used in the 3D printing. It stores the 3D information using a concept called "tessellation" where a primitive shape (*e.g.* a triangle described by three vertices and a normal) is repeated across to encode the surface geometry without overlaps and gaps. The format was invented by the _Albert Consulting Group_ for [3D systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Systems), a company co-founded by [Chuck Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull), in 1987. Chuck had then invented stereolithographic 3D printer and his company were looking for a way to transfer the information from 3D CAD models to the printer and realised they could use the concept of "tessellation" to describe the geometry. For instance, the image below shows different levels of tessellation of sphere done with a rectangle.

STL files come in two different flavours namely ASCII and Binary. 

##### ASCII 
The first line starts with the word "solid" in lower case and the last line should be the keyword "endsolid". The lines between the above contain descriptions of 3 vertex facets including their normals, the ordering of the vertices should comply with the right hand rule. A sample ASCII STL file looks like the following\: 

~~~~
solid
   :
   :
   facet normal 0.0 0.0 1.0 
   outer loop 
      vertex  1.0  1.0  0.0 
      vertex -1.0  1.0  0.0 
      vertex  0.0 -1.0  0.0 
   endloop
   endfacet
   :
   :
endsolid
~~~~


Often the normals need not be provided and they will be generated by the parsing software/system. The main restriction placed upon the facets in STL files is that all adjacent facets must share two common vertices.

##### Binary

Binary STL files consist of a 80 byte header line that can be interpreted as a comment string. The following 4 bytes interpreted as a long integer give the total number of facets. What follows is a normal and 3 vertices for each facet, each coordinate represented as a 4 byte floating point number (12 bytes in all). There is a 2 byte spacer between each facet. The result is that each facet is represented by 50 bytes, 12 for the normal, 36 for the 3 vertices, and 2 for the spacer.
