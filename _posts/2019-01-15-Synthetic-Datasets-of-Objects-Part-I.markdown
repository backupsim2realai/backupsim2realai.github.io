This is the first part of the series of posts on consolidating datasets of 3D objects and scenes and in this post, we will focus on the datasets of 3D objects. This is a modest attempt at covering the breadth of such datasets that have publicly appeared over the past one and a half decade. These datasets have been curated either via synthesising 3D models in a software or scanning real world 3D objects from multiple views with RGB as well as depth cameras. They have been immensely useful for object detection, segmentation and grasping among other applications. Historically, researchers in computer vision and graphics had a particular interest in 3D shape modelling and understanding and therefore contributed to the growth and evolution of these datasets. Notably, there have been attepmts at curating datasets by the game development community but they have remained within the confines of the community and have largely not been publicly shared or released for free. It is worth mentioning that today various companies and websites allow creating, sharing and searching 3D models *e.g.*

- [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) have a large repository of CAD models that are freely available for research purposes. They are a cloud based service for designing and sharing CAD models.
- [3DWarehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en) maintain a large collection of 3D models created in sketchup and also provide a search engine for these. The 3D models can be downloaded for free.
- [Clara](https://clara.io/library) like onshape is a cloud based 3D content creation software and provides many 3D models for free.
- [Yobi3D](https://www.yobi3d.com/) allows searching 3D models and provide links to the correponsing website where those models can be available. Not all of them are for free.
- [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/) maintain their asset store for 3D models that can be used within the Unity3D engine. High quality assets tend to require licensing and not available free of charge.

### Data formats

Similar to vector graphics for images, this representations allows resampling the surface data at arbitrary resolutions, with or without connectivity information (i.e. into a point cloud or a mesh).

[GMSH](http://gmsh.info/) 3D dimentional finite element mesh generator --- converts parametric shapes to meshes. [This link](http://gmsh.info/screencasts/) shows how to use the software.

#### STL format
The format only describes the 3D surface geometry of the object *i.e.* information about 3D vertices and normals is provided and no information of colour, texture or other possible meta-data relevant for the model is included. These files are usually generated by a CAD program and are most commonly used in the 3D printing. They store the 3D information using a concept called "tessellation" where a primitive shape (*e.g.* a triangle described by three vertices and a normal) is repeated across to encode the surface geometry without overlaps and gaps. The format was invented by the _Albert Consulting Group_ for [3D systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Systems), a company co-founded by [Chuck Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull), in 1987. Chuck had then invented stereolithographic 3D printer and his company were looking for a way to transfer the information from 3D CAD models to the printer and realised they could use the concept of "tessellation" to describe the geometry. For instance, the image below shows different levels of tessellation of sphere done with a triangle.

STL files come in two different flavours namely ASCII and Binary and contain descriptions of 3 vertex facets including their normals. The ordering of the vertices complies with the right hand rule. The main restriction placed upon the facets in STL files is that all adjacent facets must share two common vertices. 


#### OBJ format 

The OBJ format was created by [Wavefront Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_Technologies) to store lines, polygons, and free-form curves and objects. Similar to STL it stores the surface geometry but unlike STL it also stores the colour and texture information. OBJ format can approximate surface geometry without blowing up the size of the model using bezier curves or NURBS. There are multiple ways to store the geometry with OBJ format. In its simplest form, OBJ allows tessellation of the geometry in the form of triangles, quadrilaterals or more complext polygons. The vertices and normals of the polygons are stored to encode the geometry. Other ways to encode geometry with OBJ include free-form curves like bezier curves and free-form surfaces like NURBS. Free-form surfaces are more precise and they lead to smaller file sizes at higher precision compared to other methods. Although STL remains the most popular format for 3D printing, the size of the file very quickly increases for high-resolution 3D models and the lack of colour information makes it somewhat restrictive and therefore OBJ has been slowly becoming a popular choice.

<div><figure><img align="left" src="/assets/img/2019-01-15/texture_mapping.gif" width="25%"></figure> OBJ format supports colour and texture in an accompanying file with .MTL extension which allows the end-user to render a multi-coloured textured model. The MTL file encodes various intrinsic properties of object (<i>e.g.</i> ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, transparency etc.) as well as texture maps that allow mapping an image onto a 3D surface <i>e.g.</i> in the animation on the left, the 2D textured image is wrapped around the 3D cube where vertices of cube are projected on the 2D atlas and their colours are interpolated from the image. </div>


### Synthetic Datasets

Synthetic object datasets have remained popular particularly among researchers in computer vision and graphics since the early 2000s. We have listed some of the popular datasets since 2003 until 2018 in the table below. We observed that both graphics and vision researchers have focussed either on the geometry (in the form of meshes and point clouds) or variation among the classes of shapes but very little about their use within physics engines for control. Therefore, until recently, most datasets did not provide any articulation information (hinges or joints) of the objects and their parts.

Note that some of the links in the table may be outdated now but we added them anyway as this is where the datasets were uploaded first.

Moreover, we have observed that the size of the publicly available datasets of synthetic 3D objects has continued to grow linearly on logarithmic scale *i.e* the size of the biggest dataset has increased by a factor of ~10. Though ShapeNets remains as the biggest dataset but not all the models are publicly available. Recently, ABC dataset have collected 1M high quality CAD models of large variety of objects.

> For physics simulation, articulations in the form of hinges and joints as well as collisions shapes of objects in the form of bounding volumes etc. are important.


### What should an ideal object dataset look like then? 

- Should contain large variety of objects and intra-class variability. The dataset should also aim to have uniform distribution of all kinds of classes to avoid any bias towards a particular set.
- Preferably synthetic as collecting water-tight models of real world objects still remains very challenging. Not because it requires labourious scanning of the object from multiple views but it requires the intent of the reconstruction to be conveyed to the robot or user. This is more relevant when scanning objects that have hinges and joints *e.g.* one needs to open the cabinet (the intent here is to open) to see what is inside and how to scan it and ensure that the scans are registered appropriately with the previously collected ones. Scanning what is behind the object is also difficult. Therefore, synthetic object models will likely be essential to sidestep these problems. 
- Preferably CAD models so they can be sampled at arbitrary resolution without any loss of data. They are metrically accurate and can be converted to STL or OBJ format (vice-versa is lossy). Additionally, if you are stiching different CAD models together the relative rotation and translation can be easily obtained via a CAD software. This avoids the calibration/registration process that one has to do on the real world data. Furthermore, they can be 3D printed and therefore provide a perfect simulation to real world match of the 3D model.
- Should come with various object intrinsic properties like [collision shapes](https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-ii-collision-detection-for-solid-objects), physical properties (*e.g.* friction, center of mass, intertia) as well as articulation information so they can be used directly into a physics engine. If properties like friction, mass, inertia etc. are not provided there are certainly ways to estimate them via [analysis-by-synthesis approaches](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/rg/slides/galileo_slides.pdf) or calibrating the simulator to the real world with particle filters. However, it is also possible that this calibration process might yield parameters that are optimal given the objective function but not necessarily physically meaningful.

We note that despite availability of large scale of 3D models of objects, artists and designers are needed to create bespoke 3D object models and assets --- a term often called content creation. This is time consuming and requires multiple iterations between the client and the designer.
