Similar to vector graphics for images, this representations allows resampling the surface data at arbitrary resolutions, with or without connectivity information (i.e. into a point cloud or a mesh).

#### STL format
The format only describes the 3D surface geometry of the object *i.e.* information about 3D vertices and normals is provided and no information of colour, texture or other possible meta-data relevant for the model is included. These files are usually generated by a CAD program and are most commonly used in the 3D printing. They store the 3D information using a concept called "tessellation" where a primitive shape (*e.g.* a triangle described by three vertices and a normal) is repeated across to encode the surface geometry without overlaps and gaps. The format was invented by the _Albert Consulting Group_ for [3D systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Systems), a company co-founded by [Chuck Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull), in 1987. Chuck had then invented stereolithographic 3D printer and his company were looking for a way to transfer the information from 3D CAD models to the printer and realised they could use the concept of "tessellation" to describe the geometry. For instance, the image below shows different levels of tessellation of sphere done with a triangle.

STL files come in two different flavours namely ASCII and Binary and contain descriptions of 3 vertex facets including their normals. The ordering of the vertices complies with the right hand rule. The main restriction placed upon the facets in STL files is that all adjacent facets must share two common vertices. 


#### OBJ format 

The OBJ format was created by [Wavefront Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_Technologies) to store lines, polygons, and free-form curves and objects. Similar to STL it stores the surface geometry but unlike STL it also stores the colour and texture information. OBJ format can approximate surface geometry without blowing up the size of the model using bezier curves or NURBS. There are multiple ways to store the geometry with OBJ format. In its simplest form, OBJ allows tessellation of the geometry in the form of triangles, quadrilaterals or more complext polygons. The vertices and normals of the polygons are stored to encode the geometry. Other ways to encode geometry with OBJ include free-form curves like bezier curves and free-form surfaces like NURBS. Free-form surfaces are more precise and they lead to smaller file sizes at higher precision compared to other methods. Although STL remains the most popular format for 3D printing, the size of the file very quickly increases for high-resolution 3D models and the lack of colour information makes it somewhat restrictive and therefore OBJ has been slowly becoming a popular choice.

<div style="Margin:20px"><figure><img align="left"  src="/assets/img/2019-01-15/texture_mapping.gif" width="30%"></figure> OBJ format supports colour and texture in an accompanying file with `.MTL` extension which allows the end-user to render a multi-coloured textured model. The MTL file encodes the [BRDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function) properties (*e.g.* ambient color, diffuse color, specular color, transparency etc.) as well as texture maps that allow mapping an image onto a 3D surface *e.g.* in the example below, the 2D textured image is wrapped around the 3D cube. </div>

> For physics simulation, articulations in the form of hinges and joints as well as collisions shapes of objects in the form of bounding volumes etc. are important.


### What should an ideal object dataset look like? 

- Should contain large variety of objects and intra-class variability. 
- Preferably synthetic as collecting water-tight models of real world objects still remains very challenging. 
- Preferably CAD models so they can be downsampled/upsampled to any arbitrary resolution without any loss of data. 
- Should come with collision shapes as well as articulation information so they can be used directly into a physics engine.
